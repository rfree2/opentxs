This are instructions for build, from scratch, on some linux-like platforms,
where you need tools newer then provided. This includes Debian 7.
This is testes and confirmed as of 2014.09.16 on current debian and opentxs.

- use local compiler (if your system wide is not good enough)
- no root: install all locally as given user (in ~/.local/)
- use clang
- btw use ccache (includes now fix for that older ccache, for clang support)

This is instruction e.g. for anyone joining development now on current Debian Stable 7,
or wanting to use newer compiler then default one.

-----------------------------------

1. Dependencies build and installation
2. Open Transaction build
3. Subprojects build (opentxs-srv, opentxs-cli aka otshell)
(reserved)
8. Run the software
9. Run other software: MoneyChanger

-----------------------------------
1.
a)
Install dependencies:
	# apt-get install wget git libtool make cmake pkg-config automake libboost-all-dev libzmq-dev libmsgpack-dev libssl-dev protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev
Library libzmq-dev actually is not important since we will probably use the bundled one (see below).

b) clang and ccache installation
Install ccache:
	# apt-get install ccache

As user we recommend to build from sources clang compiler in some new version
e.g. at least clang 3.3 (as of 2014-09). We would advice to build it per-user, using PREFIX=$HOME/.local/ when configuring

On debian 7 good setup is to system-wide install clang from repository (3.2)
and user-local build clang 3.3:
	# apt-get install clang

	$ mkdir ~/llvm && cd ~/llvm

Download sources:
$execute:
	wget http://www.llvm.org/releases/3.4.1/cfe-3.4.1.src.tar.gz
	wget http://www.llvm.org/releases/3.4.1/cfe-3.4.1.src.tar.gz.sig
	wget http://www.llvm.org/releases/3.4.1/llvm-3.4.1.src.tar.gz
	wget http://www.llvm.org/releases/3.4.1/llvm-3.4.1.src.tar.gz.sig

Verify downloads:
$execute:
	sha512sum *gz

should give:
	3886d2e362aab52f29520150a81271ee24433118e0519dd5d1c58cfacc3b1c7da4cbab49c7e82d6b4a90c278b5028f5aa1f5d79478b13d0b11a15c491a6c00d5  cfe-3.4.1.src.tar.gz
	a8d19f8560604cd1a62b9868aca8848c0675895c5354dfcbc81ef940d4a38f56f8239a49aec853dd7d432134fa0b5feb9b070579226400874b761dcf124f7a7b  llvm-3.4.1.src.tar.gz


Packages should be signed with key with fingerprint: C135 49BB 82A1 7681 BF71  43C2 B446 8DF4 E95C 63DC
$execute:
	gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys E95C63DC
	gpg --verify cfe-3.4.1.src.tar.gz.sig
	gpg --verify llvm-3.4.1.src.tar.gz.sig

Verification output should look like:
$execute:
	gpg: Signature made Tue 06 May 2014 17:53:48 CEST using RSA key ID 02119294
	gpg: Good signature from "Tom Stellard <tom@stellard.net>"
	gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
	gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
	Primary key fingerprint: 11E5 21D6 4698 2372 EB57  7A1F 8F08 71F2 0211 9294

Unpack and prepare to build:
$execute:
	tar -xzf llvm-3.4.1.src.tar.gz
	tar -xzf cfe-3.4.1.src.tar.gz
	mv cfe-3.4.1.src llvm-3.4.1.src/tools/clang
	mkdir build
	cd build

Build:
If compiling with clang - must pass full path to compiler
	CC=/usr/bin/clang CXX=/usr/bin/clang++ ../llvm-3.4.1.src/configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
	ionice -c3 make -j2
	make install

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selecting compiler for Open-Transactions (and other env options)

This settings work for all parts: opentxs, opentxs-srv, opentxs-cli

On Linux/Unix, edit ~/.bashrc to use given compiler, by appending following lines:

CCACHE_FIX=""
CCACHE_FIX="-Qunused-arguments -Wno-deprecated-register" ; echo "WARNING: Version for old ccache, working around"; # on debian7
export CC="ccache $HOME/.local/bin/clang $CCACHE_FIX" ; export CXX="ccache $HOME/.local/bin/clang++ $CCACHE_FIX" ; export CPP="$HOME/.local/bin/clang -E" 
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$HOME/.local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH" # local
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$HOME/.local/lib:$HOME/.local/lib64" # local
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$HOME/.local/" # local
export MAKEFLAGS='-j 4' # depending on system!

Skip the line CCACHE_FIX="-Q..." if you have modern ccache that understands clang flags fully.
The lines marked "local" are for using local build (libs and software will be taken from/placed to ~/.local/)
The -j option to makefile depends on computer, if you have enough RAM then try *1 or *2 number of CPU cores.

DO NOT FORGET to also run this command:
  source ~/.bashrc # re-read the settings to use them right now

If you do not want to use ccache or local compiler you might consider instead replacing proper lines with either:
export CC="ccache $HOME/.local/bin/clang" ; export CXX="ccache $HOME/.local/bin/clang++" ; export CPP="$HOME/.local/bin/clang -E"
export CC="ccache clang" ; export CXX="ccache clang++" ; export CPP="clang -E"
export CC="clang" ; export CXX="clang++" ; export CPP="clang -E"

Keep in mind that certain parts of Open-Transactiona, like otcli (othint) sub-project might require new enough compiler version;
It might be possible to set compiler for sub-project separatelly see subproject doc (e.g. in otcli/ a.k.a. othint/).

After applying this changes (if you build previously with other compiler choice) you must clear cmake cache using:
	rm -rf build/
before trying again, and do not forget to reload ~/.bashrc as above.

-----------------------------------
2. Build and install Open Transactions:

	git@github.com:open-transactions/opentxs.git
	cd opentxs
	git submodule init && git submodule update # this step is needed to be run manually for some systems
	mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local/ -D FORCE_BUNDLED_ZMQ_LIB=ON .. && make install

-----------------------------------
3. Subprojects build

opentxs-server build will be described in the documentation of that project. The process will be probably similar.

opentxs-cli build will be described in the documentation of that project. That project, a.k.a otshell, the command line interface
is now moved to https://github.com/rfree2/opentxs-cli (lead developer's version)
and to repo at https://github.com/Open-Transactions/opentxs-cli (OT developer's version).

-----------------------------------
4. to 7. are reserved chapters


-----------------------------------
8. Run the software

Follow instructions in other doc about how to start the software.
One option would be to copy the sample-data, then start ot server, then start in-development otcli/othint, or use existing
and working "ot" client.

echo "this will delete server data!!!" ; read _  
mkdir -p ~/.ot && cp -R sample-data/ot-sample-data/* ~/.ot
and go to e.g. ~/.local/bin and run ./otserver 

Then follow instructions for otcli e.g. in src/othint/ (this directory name can change in future to otcli)


9. Run other software: MoneyChanger


*** This might be deprecated now; See also other sources. This is the way that worked as of 2014-04 ***


Running MoneyChanger on Debian 7, for OT lib that was build as above (was build with llvm 3.3);
Tester on MC version d1c9eb7bac944c9a941c6778d358aa2e97693e5b (Thu Apr 24 18:22:57 2014 +1200)


git clone https://github.com/Open-Transactions/Moneychanger.git
cd Moneychanger/project/
qmake 
make 

it will stop with error, you need to export path:
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/.local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
then run again:
make

it will crash gcc (at least gcc (Debian 4.7.2-5) 4.7.2), with error:
  compiling ../../src/bitcoin-api/btchelper.cpp
  g++: internal compiler error: Segmentation fault (program cc1plus)

we need to use llvm compiler:
in file Moneychanger/project/bitcoin-api/Makefile.Release
	change lines
CC            = @echo compiling $< && gcc
CXX           = @echo compiling $< && g++
	to
CC            = @echo compiling $< && clang
CXX           = @echo compiling $< && clang++
